Nemo
====
File Manager for Cinnamon

Nemo is the file manager for the Cinnamon desktop environment. 

HOW to build the packages:
cd nemo
dpgk-buildpackages
cd ..
sudo dpkg -i *.deb

Last line installes the nemo packages. If you have any bugs let me know, and you can update nemo with the update manager anytime to get back to the official version.
